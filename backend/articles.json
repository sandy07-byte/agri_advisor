    "image": "/articles/article_images/ssnm.webp",
    "content": "This review article explains how soil health — the combined physical, chemical and biological state of soil — is critical for crop productivity and environmental sustainability. It identifies major issues in Indian agriculture such as declining organic matter, nutrient deficits, soil structural degradation and overuse of chemical fertilisers. The authors highlight practices such as balanced fertilisation, organic matter incorporation, cover cropping and site-specific nutrient delivery as pathways to restoring soil function. For example, site-specific nutrient management allows farmers to apply fertilisers based on local soil test data, reducing waste and improving efficiency. The review also emphasises the role of extension services and policy mechanisms in supporting adoption of better nutrient practices. (Manish R. Pandao et al. 2024)\n\nExpanding further, the article notes that soil biological activity acts as a vital indicator of ecosystem health. Microbial biomass and enzyme activities directly influence nutrient mineralisation and availability to plants. The decline of soil biodiversity due to intensive monocropping and chemical input dependency has created imbalances that cannot be corrected by fertiliser use alone. The review calls for integrated nutrient management (INM), which combines chemical fertilisers, organic manures, and biofertilisers to create a more resilient soil ecosystem. The authors also propose digital soil health cards and AI-supported monitoring tools for continuous assessment of soil fertility trends. For future research, the paper highlights the need for region-specific soil health models linked to climatic data and crop rotation patterns to ensure precision fertiliser recommendations at the local level.",

    "title": "Impact of Integrated Nutrient Management on Soil Properties under Long-Term Fertilizer Experiment in Vertisol",
    "excerpt": "Long-term experiments show how combined use of organic and inorganic fertilisers improves soil nutrient reserves and fertility.",
    "image": "/articles/article_images/fertilizer_img.jpg",
    "content": "This original research investigates long–term fertiliser treatments (in a wheat-soybean cropping system in Vertisol soil) and assesses changes in soil properties like pH, SOC (soil organic carbon), available N, P and K at two depths (0-15 cm and 15-30 cm). The results indicate that integrated use of 100% NPK plus farm-yard manure significantly improved soil nutrient status compared to other treatments. The study underlines that fertiliser management over years has a profound effect on soil health and thus productivity. It also signals that any fertiliser recommendation system must take into account historic fertiliser use and soil nutrient carry-over. (Chandini Pradhan et al. 2024)\n\nThe long-term experiment further reveals that chemical fertiliser use alone tends to increase soil acidity and reduce microbial activity over time, whereas the inclusion of organic manures enhances soil buffering capacity and microbial biomass. Organic inputs improve the physical structure of Vertisol, making it more permeable and reducing compaction. The authors propose that national fertiliser guidelines should move away from fixed NPK rates and instead consider multi-year soil data to predict residual fertility effects. The research also demonstrates how crop yields stabilise over time when balanced fertiliser regimes are maintained, confirming that long-term sustainability depends on both chemical and organic inputs. The study concludes that INM principles should form the foundation of modern fertiliser recommendation systems, integrating soil test data with the history of management practices, organic amendments, and crop rotations for predictive modelling of nutrient availability.",

    "excerpt": "Using generative-AI approaches and soil/weather datasets to build smarter fertiliser recommendation models.",
    "image": "/articles/article_images/ai_img.jpg",
    "content": "This recent article (2025) outlines how generative AI algorithms can be used to optimise fertiliser application by ingesting large datasets — including soil nutrient measurements, weather forecast data, crop history and remote sensing inputs. The system produces personalised fertiliser dosage and timing recommendations for specific fields, reducing over-application and improving crop yields. It also discusses challenges like data quality, model interpretability and integration with extension services. The article is highly relevant to your project because it directly addresses how to build a fertiliser-recommendation system using advanced data-driven methods. (Journal IJSRA, 2025)\n\nThe paper expands on how generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can simulate synthetic soil-climate scenarios to forecast nutrient requirements dynamically. These models can be trained on historical yield data, soil sensor readings, and satellite imagery to generate nutrient maps for precision agriculture. The researchers present a case study from Maharashtra where AI-based fertiliser recommendations improved nitrogen use efficiency by 18%. Moreover, the article explores the role of cloud-based dashboards for farmers to visualize nutrient imbalances and receive real-time advisory alerts. Ethical considerations are also discussed, particularly data ownership and algorithmic transparency. The authors advocate for open-source AI models co-developed with agricultural universities to ensure accessibility for smallholder farmers in developing regions. The study concludes that generative AI could revolutionise fertiliser recommendations by bridging data science and agronomy for sustainable farming futures.",

    "excerpt": "SSNM offers a structured framework (“4Rs”) to optimise fertiliser use in variable field conditions for higher efficiency and sustainability.",
    "image": "/articles/article_images/soil1_img4.jpg",
    "content": "This review article outlines the concept of Site Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM), which emphasises the ‘4 R’ principles: right product, right rate, right time, right place. It describes advanced tools (optical sensors, canopy sensors, variable-rate technology, fertility mapping) that support SSNM and highlights how this approach is key to addressing soil variability, improving nutrient uptake efficiency and enhancing climate resilience of cropping systems. For a fertiliser recommendation system, SSNM offers a guiding framework on how to tailor fertiliser guidance at fine spatial scales. (Sarma et al. 2024)\n\nExpanding further, the review points out that SSNM integrates remote sensing, GIS mapping, and IoT-based soil sensors to create high-resolution nutrient variability maps. These technologies enable precise application of inputs in variable field zones, cutting down costs and reducing nutrient losses to the environment. The paper compares case studies from Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, where SSNM adoption led to a 15–25% reduction in fertiliser use without compromising yields. It also discusses how SSNM principles can be integrated into digital platforms, linking soil-test data and weather forecasts to automatically generate fertiliser schedules. Moreover, the authors stress that implementing SSNM requires strong institutional support, including farmer training, digital literacy, and cost-sharing models for precision equipment. The review concludes that combining SSNM with AI-based analytics can significantly enhance nutrient use efficiency while maintaining long-term soil health and climate resilience.",
